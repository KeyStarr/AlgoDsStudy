/**
 * LC-743 https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  â€¢ 1 <= nodesAmount <= 100;
 *  â€¢ 1 <= edges.size <= 6000;
 *  â€¢ 0 <= edges\[i].weight <= 100;
 *  â€¢ no self edges, all edges are unique.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  â€¢ 1st approach => I UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM'S STATEMENT WRONG, don't even remember now what it was;
 *  â€¢ 2nd approach => AGAIN I UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM'S STATEMENT WRONG, this time I thought we must reach all nodes
 *   within a single path)))) (actually, I assumed that for the 1st approach as well)
 *  â€¢ finally I gave up and read the solution, didn't understand why it'd work => dry ran the algo on a single example
 *  from the problem => realized that we can actually reach nodes on multiple paths ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  â€¢ how do I minimize such crude misunderstanding of the problem statement in the future?
 *   I guess here what happened is that I solved too many problems on graphs which asked for a metric of a single best
 *   path, so I inherently assumed for this problem that we have to reach all nodes in a single traversal! When in reality
 *   it, kind of muddily, states that we might take as many paths as we want "We will send a signal from a given node k".
 *   In hindsight, the problem doesn't very clearly state this multi-path solution property.
 *
 *  â€¢ practiced recognizing and using a Dijkstra's algorithm for an efficient solution to the weighted graph problem;

     *    - an adjacency array of weighted edges, edges\[i]={source,destination,weight}. Weight=the amount of time it takes for
     *     a signal to reach destination from source.
     *   - startNode: Int
     *  - goal: return the minimum path weight towards the node with the max path weight amongst others, but only if all nodes
     *   are reachable from [startNode]. otherwise return -1
     *   (i.o. return the path weight towards the node with the max path weight amongst all nodes with minimized path weights, or -1)
     *
     * algorithm design:
     * 1. min path weight => Dijkstra's?
     * we need to visit all nodes, BUT NOT IN A SINGLE PATH. however, for each node we want to know only the minimum path
     *  weight it takes to reach it => certainly try Dijkstra's.
     * 2. how to determine that some nodes weren't reached? iterate through `minWeights` at the end of traversal, return
     *  -1 if any node has its default path weight value.
     *
     * Time: average/worst O((nodes+edges)*log(nodes))
     *  - dijkstra's traversal, not always all nodes might be reachable from start node [startNode], but in the worst case
     *   all nodes are => the traversal takes O((nodes + edges)*log(nodes))), and on average it depends on it;
     *  - determining -1 and finding max takes O(n).
     * Space: always O(n)
     *  - heap in worst case at first has O(n) elements where each node is connected with each, then the number depends on it;
     *  - minPathWeights always takes O(n)

     *    - an adjacency array of weighted edges, edges\[i]={source,destination,weight}. Weight=the amount of time it takes for
     *     a signal to reach destination from source.
     *   - startNode: Int
     *  - goal: return the minimum valid path weight or -1 if that's impossible.
     *      valid = path that visits all nodes starting from [startNode]
     *
     * what approach to use?
     *  - we certainly need graph traversal => how to visit all nodes efficiently while finding the minimum total path weight,
     *   but visiting all nodes?
     *  - weights => Dijkstra's? basically visit node X only if current path weight to it is greater than the path weight
     *   we've already taken to it previously. we still have the same edges from X node regardless of the prior context;
     *  - how to determine when not all nodes received the signal? idea - keep a track of how many nodes we've visited
     *   across the path to each node. When comparing the
     *
     *
     *   just either count the amount of unique nodes we encounter, or at the end simply iterate through `maxEfforts` array
     *   and return -1 if any node still has its default value.
