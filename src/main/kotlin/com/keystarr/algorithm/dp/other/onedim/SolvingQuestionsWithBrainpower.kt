/**
 * LC-2140 https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  â€¢ 1 <= questions.length <= 10^5
 *  â€¢ question\[i].length == 2
 *  â€¢ 1 <= points\i, brainpower\i <= 10^5
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  â€¢ it's peculiar how we've started [topDown] from the 0th index and [bottomUp] from the (n-1) index, directly
 *   opposite to [HouseRobber], [LongestIncreasingSubsequence], [MinCostClimbingStairs]. Why? In all these problems
 *   our current choice affects future choices, it's just that in this particular problem the next valid node can be further
 *   at an unknown length + ðŸ”¥ the base case is actually at the (n-1) not at the 0th index;
 *  â€¢ why is the base case at (n-1)? Well, we might've started from the beginning of the array with the right index for topDown,
 *   like I tried with [topDownWrong], but I hit the wall there not able to get a correct solution.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  â€¢ practiced both top-down and bottom-up DP;
 *  â€¢ apparently some DP problems are best to start top-down from the 0th index, and bottom-up from the end?
 *   And some the other way around? Why? TODO: why??? postponing cause I've hit a wall rn

    /**
     * (WRONG APPROACH, see [topDown]. Left here for later reflection)
     * TODO: why does that approach not work? Is it generally wrong or did I make an implementation error?
     *
     * Analysis:
     *  - goal is max
     *  - we have to make multiple choices AND each choice affects further choices (since brainpower is always > 0)
     * => try DP
     *
     * Once again, the main bulk of the design is in the drawing in Obsidian.
     *
     * The core idea for top down is - we have a choice, whether to solve the ith question or not to take it:
     *  - if we solve it, then we must find the first question before it that has the brainpower such that, if we solve
     *   that jth question, we can still take the ith question => the answer would be q\[i].points + maxProfit(j)
     *  - if we skip the ith question, we need to check all questions in the range of [j+1:i-1] and find the best profit amongst
     *   them (cause if we take any of them, we won't be able to take the ith question, we need to consider that possibility).
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - max points sum is when all brainpower is 1 => (10^5/2)*10.5 = 10^10/2 => doesn't fit into int, we need Long for the sum;
     *  - for ith question there is no question before it such that we can solve jth question and still take the ith =>
     *   than the answer to the current sub-problem is only the profit for the ith question.
