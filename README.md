Howdy, folks!

I recently started to truly study algorithms and data structures. I've had various grasps on the subject, but 
never in a comprehensive and at-my-own-pace kinda way. I want to do it for 2 reasons:
1. I love software engineering and am genuinely interested in what tools I might discover to do better work, especially so for backend and gamedev;
2. I want to advance my career and work on the best products within the best of teams. It seems that most of those require a rigorous algorithm interview.

Why this rep?
1. I wanna see 'em pretty commit cells painted green as I progress;
2. it's a chance to get feedback should anyone like you decide to tell me exactly why my code is garbage (please, do!); 
3. social accountability - even if no one looks, I feel your eyes on my back. That hopefully will drive me to push cleaner code more regularly.

Over the years I've grown to think that algorithms are an impenetrable foe I cannot defeat, but recently I've found new tools that might
actually crack it. This is a very important challenge for me (coming of age, really), so, heh, let's see how this turns out.

Thanks for stopping by, and may the HashMap be with you.
