/**
 * LC-491 https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-subsequences/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * Final notes:
 *  - ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è failed to come up with a working solution by myself in 1h;
 *  - its so weird, this problem is quite default for a backtracking type problems, yet I've failed to come up with a solution!
 *   Thought about backtracking especially after seeing the constraints (n <= 15!!) but still tried to go for the "most optimal route"
 *   straight away and though I've seen duplicating subproblems - could try DP [topDownDp] => failed miserably;
 *  - I still think it is doable with DP, but probably it's just harder, might as well try later. Welp, should've tried
 *   to go back to backtracking to AT LEAST do a brute force solution when the "most optimal" route didn't work out;
 *  - üî•üî• same ol' tricks for backtracking as with subsets: use a seen set to not try same numbers for the same position
 *   + consider only number to the right of the current, both to avoid duplicates.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  - practiced efficiently solving a "generate all valid combinations=subsequences" type problem using backtracking;
 *  - üí° reinforced TO NOT OVERCOMMIT FOR to the most optimal route! Try brute force first if things don't work out in 10-20 minutes!
 *   here though I was quite convinced that I was doing the right thing up until, like, the 40th minute :D

     * goal = generate all possible valid subsequences of [nums].
     *  valid = constraints:
     *   1. non-decreasing;
     *   2. size > 1;
     *   3. distinct.
     *
     * tricky part - how to avoid duplicates?
     *
     * for the problem asks for generating all of something => try backtracking for optimized brute force
     *
     * approach - for each position of the potential subsequence consider all possible options, but:
     *  1. don't same number multiple times for a position, as that would lead to duplicates;
     *  2. as we go to add more numbers, consider only numbers to the right of the last picked number's index;
     *  3. respect the non-decreasing constraint;
     *  4. add any intermediate/final subsequence of size > 1.
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(2^n)
     *  - total iterations to generate all subsequences (without any pruning) would be 2^n, since the algorithm then forms a
     *   decision tree, where for every number we decide whether to take it or not;
     *  - pruning provides optimization, yet worst case is [nums] is entirely a strictly increasing subsequence with distinct
     *   numbers => neither duplicate number same pos nor non-decreasing pruning executes => 2^n iterations.
     * Space: average/worst O(n)
     *  - worst height of the callstack is n;
     *  - seen set grows up to n.

     * also could've used IntArray(size=200) instead of the hashset for potentially a slightly better time const

     * backtracking? do suproblems overlap though? yea they do
     *  e.g. 4,6,7,7 if we start either from 4 or 6, when we reach the first 7 the question is "return all non-decr subsequences

     * ------------------
     *
     * submit fail, problem: how to generate all possible subsequences using all duplicate numbers YET not repeat any of the subsequences?
     * major case: we have more than 2 duplicate elements
     * e.g. 1 1 1
     *
     * leftInd=2 => [[1]]
     * leftInd=1 => [[1, 1 1]]
     * leftInd=0 => [[1 1, 1 1 1]]
     *
     * => ah-huh, so if have any nextNumber == currentNumber then don't add currentNumber as a subsequence of 1 size,
     *  since we've already considered all subsequences starting with that? wrong
     *
     *
     *
     * try alternative DP?
     * goal - return all non-decreasing subsequences of nums\[:rightInd] that END with the number nums\[rightInd]
