/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a very general basic problem beautifully solved with efficient DP.
 * LC-1143 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 10^3
 *  ‚Ä¢ str1 and str2 consist of only lowercase English chars
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ üí°‚ö†Ô∏è tried solving myself, but failed [bruteforce], too slow. O(n^2*m^2) VS O(n*m) time required, way too slow.
 *   so I did inefficient DP, huh? Is it even DP? Well yea, we make 1 step each time of all possible valid combination, right?
 *   AHH I actually just did a bruteforce with optimized const yea)))))
 *  ‚Ä¢ actual DP [topDownDp] is way more efficient cause we don't make that many calls. Why though? Still don't have it
 *   at my fingertips, like, what EXACTLY is different from the [bruteforce] approach?
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è failed 5 submission. New anti-record, huh)) Both anti-records are with DP;
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏èforgot memoization before submitting again, LOL;
 *  ‚Ä¢ the idea behind the efficient bottom-up DP here is simple: start with the valid subproblem of minimum size
 *   (1 last char of each string), solve it (depends on next chars, which don't exist here so its 0 for them => that initial
 *   subproblem is solvable as-is. basically these base cases are in the result array prefilled (0)) => increase the subproblem
 *   size based on reason. If the chars at current positions in both strings match => find LCE for the subproblem with skipping
 *   these both chars, like, what else can we use to get LCE + this once char? If chars don't match, try both valid steps
 *   and choose the max => either skip the char in the first string, or in the second. Since we're going right to left,
 *   we know already all answers to subproblems without the chars we're skipping
 *   => at each step we're deciding whether to add +1 char to the LCE if chars match, and adding that to the LCE of all
 *   next characters, gradually combining the answer for the full original subproblem = both full strings.
 *  ‚Ä¢ is it even worth it to dry-run entire cases for DP? I do that for like the 3rd or the 4th problem in a row, but
 *   I feel like I'm expecting an insight, but either it is so subtle I almost don't notice or it's not happening. I rather
 *   enjoy the contrast of monotonic labor with these, but I feel like it's not worth the time investment. Though here
 *   before dry-running the bottom-up approach I didn't clearly see exactly why the answer is in results[0][0] and now I
 *   clearly do (cause it's accumulated result for the full problem).
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•first-time solved a multidimensional (2D) DP problem, good boy;
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced DP top-down left-to-right and bottom-up right-to-left;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•‚≠êÔ∏è realized that I may be thinking I'm doing DP but actually doing brute-force. basically elements^2 time (elements=n*m)
 *   certainly hints at that! maybe just slightly with the optimized const;
 *  ‚Ä¢ REMEMBER TO MEMOIZE BEFORE SUBMITTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *  ‚Ä¢ full dry-running DP so far actually seems to worth it for now.

     *
     * -----------------------------------
     *
     * what approach?
     *  - goal: best (max) valid combination (common subsequence in both strings)
     *  - multiple choices, each choice affects further ones (chosen char X in str1, gotta find exactly X in str2 too now)
     *  - possible duplicate subproblems, cause same char may be selected as a part of the subsequence in both strings with
     *   different preceding chars (in different subsequences)
     * => try DP
     *
     * why only lowercase English char? Can we leverage that?
     *
     * top-down
     * - return value: longest common subsequence length
     * - what do we do for 1 step?
     *  choose the same character in both str1 and str2, at the index of the common substring
     * - how do we reduce the problem?
     *  in str1 we consider further choices only starting from the index i
     *  in str2 from the index j
     * - how many options do we have at each step?
     *  maxSubsequenceLength = subsequenceLength
     *  iterate through str1 starting from i, for each char
     *   iterate through str2 and try to find it (could be optimized),
     *    if it exists, call dp(i=str1Ind+1,j=str2Ind+1)
     *    for each such case
     *    if the result is greater than maxSubsequenceLength, write into it
     *  return maxSubsequenceLength + 1
     * => recurrence relation: dp(i,j) = max(dp(i=str1Ind+1,j=str2Ind+1)) + 1
     *  also interesting, for i there might be different j, and for j different i, meaning same char in one string may
     *  match in a subsequence with the same char but on different positions in the other string
     *  => 2D DP
     *
     * - base cases?
     *  i>str1Ind or j>str2Ind => return 0
     *
     * - how to cache?
     *  the result of the call dp(i=X, j=Y) depends on both X and Y => since max X and Y is only worst 1000 => try a 2D array
     *  with worst 10^6 total elements. Array<IntArray>(size=str1.length) { IntArray(size = str2.length) }, where the first index is i and the
     *  second is j.
     *  note that str1.length may be != str.length
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - no common subsequence with length >0 => return 0, cause "" is always a common valid subsequence
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(n^2*m^2)
     *  - worst we have both str1 and str2 at max length=10^3 and each consisting of the same single character
     *   => there will be 10^3*10^3=10^6 total possible valid subsequences
     *   so, on average, total states count, each we compute only once due to caching would be O(n*m),
     *   where n=str1.length and m=str2.length
     * - for each state we run i through (i..str1.length-1) chars, and each run we run through (j..str2.length-1) chars
     *  => the work for each state (making calls to dp and finding max CS) takes O(n*m) again
     * Space: always O(n*m)
     *  - n*m for caching
     *  - worst callstack height = longest possible subsequence = min(n,m)
     *
     * -----------------
     *
     * can we improve the work at the single state?
     *  how to find efficiently for str1\[newI] an index newJ such that str1\[newI]==str2\[newJ], with newJ starting from j?
     *  could pre-process str2 into a Map<Char,List<Int>> where the value is the list of all indices of the given (key) char.
     *  could also keep the list sorted for binary search => with the added cost of O(str2.length) time and O(str2.length) space
     *  reduce the work at each state to O(str1*log(str2.length)), where str2.length in reality would be much less due to
     *  the binary search being performed only through the indices of the given character, and starting from the index j.
     * => total time then O(n*m*n*log(m)=O(n^2*m*logm)
     *  total space stays O(n*m)
     *
     * (implemented only partially without binary search, so, technically, only improved the original const)

    /**
     * - what is a step?
     *  unlike [bruteforce], try simply considering str1\[i] and str2\[j], and move only 1 character at a time:
     *   - if str1\[i] == str2\[j] => return dp(i+1,j+1) + 1
     *    i.o. discard both characters in a single move and increase the result subsequence by 1
     *   - otherwise try separately discarding str1\[i] and str2\[j]
     *
     * - how do we reduce the problem?
     *  by discarding 1 char for both strings, either at the same time, or individually
     *
     * - how many options at 1 step, how to choose?
     *  if chars don't match, we have either dp(i+1,j) or dp(i,j+1) to contribute to the answer. since we're asked for
     *  the max LCS => choose max between both
     *
     * => recurrence relation:
     *  if (str1\[i] == str2\[j]) return dp(i+1,j+1) + 1
     *  else return max( dp(i+1,j), dp(i,j+1)
     *
     * - base cases?
     *  since we're starting i and j from 0 and increasing each always by 1 at a single step =>
     *  i == str1.length || j == str2.length
     *
     * - memoization?
     *  the sub-problem is defined via both i and j, and both worst lengths are 1000 => try a 2D array of size 1000*1000
     *
     * Edge cases:
     *  - both strings have no common subsequence => return 0, cause '' is always a valid common subsequence => correct
     *
     * Time: O(n*m)
     *  - if chars match, we make only 1 recurrent call, otherwise 2 calls. Worst amount of calls is when both strings
     *   have no LCE with length >0 => we try n*m states, where n=str1.length and m=str2.length
     *  - work done at each state is O(1)
     * Space: O(n*m)
     *  - cache is n*m
     *  - worst callstack height is m or n
