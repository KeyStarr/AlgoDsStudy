/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a stark example of "generate the best valid combination" type problem with a solution more optimal than backtracking
 * LC-1663 https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= targetLength <= 10^5;
 *  ‚Ä¢ targetLength <= targetValue <= 26 * targetLength.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è TLE'd on [wrongBacktracking] in 17 mins;
 *   I could feel that this is a wrong approach, given that max targetLength is 10^5, 2^(10^5) is certainly way too inefficient :D
 *   Why did I waste time on backtracking then, why didn't go straight to another approach? After the gym, want to eat =>
 *   maybe I'm just on autopilot more than not rn?
 *   ‚ö†Ô∏è still, I could totally prevent it and DID NOT! Also, I estimated at first worst time to be 26*targetLength and
 *    went like "ah, that's fast enough, only 26 chars here backtracking might work!" BUT MAN HOW COULD I! Yep, probably
 *    low on sugar on something. ‚ö†Ô∏èüî• TOTALLY PREVENTABLE! BACKTRACKING IS NEVER THE ANSWER ON LENGTHS THAT LARGE CAUSE OF EXPONENT RELATIONSHIP WITH LENGTH!!!!
 *  ‚Ä¢ üèÖ‚ö†Ô∏è done [efficient] by myself in 45 mins;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•üî• at first didn't see a solution other than backtracking whatsoever, then reduced the possible solution space to
 *   look for time complexity <= n^2, possibly n, and finally that probably there are some tricks/formulas given how narrow
 *   constraints we have on available numbers for generation and both exact length/total value
 *   => tried to reason from the SMALLEST INPUT SIZE, start at right/left, what is the best possible choice we can make
 *    at a SINGLE STEP at the simplest input state? (full leftValue, empty result so far!!!!!)
 *    üåü what are the best choices for the first small step => build on it.
 *  ‚Ä¢ if I hadn't gone the backtracking path, wouldn't even design it after checking it wouldn't fit the time constraints
 *   on the max required length => I could save ~17 mins => finish the problem at about 30 mins mark => that would be
 *   perfectly acceptable for a medium => üî• try to eliminate tools as early as possible.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ solved a "generate the best valid combination" type problem using greedy and not backtracking! greedy based on
 *   a couple of tricky observations given the constraints about the current best choice;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•REINFORCED that generation problems with max combination length constraint more than a couple dozen IS NEVER BACKTRACKING.
 *   by failing and learning [backtrack] :D so funny I even went for it, oh man.

     * ok, backtracking is wrong => what smart tricks can we use here, some formulas to reduce the possible solutions space
     *  down to linear time or nlogn, at least a square??
     *
     * observation:
     *  - we could compute the minimum string value achievable = [targetLength].
     *   => then ([targetValue] - minValidValue) is the diff that we need to fill by increasing our characters values.
     *  - note: we want characters as small as possible as early as possible
     *   => we could try to generate the string backwards and attempt to reduce the remainder by the most VALID amount
     *    for each position. Valid = we must have at least `positionsLeft` to fill values in the `leftValue`, aside from
     *    that at each step we want to take out as much as we can. If that condition is broken, then we select the current character
     *    to be as large as we can without violating that constraint => fill the rest positions with 'a'.
     *
     * so the main tool here is greedy.

     * r = yaa     vL = 1
     * minNextValidLeftValue=3-0-1=2
     * maxValidChar=min(26,27-2)=min(26,25)=25 (y)
     *
     * minNextValidLeftValue=3-1-1=1
     * maxValidChar=min(26,2-1)=1 (a)

     *  - each iteration costs O(1);

     * WOW, wrong => TLE on 13th/94 testcases.
     *
     * -------------
     *
     * problem rephrase:
     *  - given:
     *   - targetLength: Int
     *   - targetValue: Int
     *  Goal: generate and return the best valid string
     *   valid = length equals [targetLength] and numeric value (sum of all chars number values, only English lowercase, a is 1)
     *    equals [targetValue]
     *   best = smallest lexicographically
     *
     * are only English lowercase chars allowed in the output string? Not specified directly in the problem, no one to ask,
     *  assume so judging by the examples and the general direction.
     *
     * approach: try backtracking? worst amount of combinations to try is 26 * 10^5, which is fairly reasonable.
     *  - since we want the lexicographically smallest string => for each position try lowercase English characters in alphabetical order;
     *  - keep track of the valueLeft: Int, prune if:
     *   - valueLeft < 0
     *   - length == targetLength
     *  - if valueLeft == 0 return the answer. Each step we prioritized the smallest possible numerically characters =>
     *   and increased the char value only backwards => the result is the lexicographically smallest valid string.
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - min possible valid string value is targetLength * 1 and max possible is targetLength * 26 => if targetValue is
     *   either less than targetLength or greater than targetLength * 26, there is no valid answer
     *   => such input is impossible according to input constraints
     *   => AT LEAST ONE VALID STRING IS GUARANTEED TO EXIST => answer always exists.
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(targetLength)
     *  - worst is the only valid string is 'z' * targetLength => we would have tried g ^ [targetLength] combinations then,
     *   where g = amount of allowed characters, here g=26, so time is O(26*targetLength)=O(targetLength)
     * Space: O(targetLength)
     *  - worst callstack height is [targetLength];
     *  - result stringbuilder max length is [targetLength]
