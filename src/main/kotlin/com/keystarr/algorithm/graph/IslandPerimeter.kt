/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a great example of a graph problem with custom traversal, not pure DFS/BFS adapting to the matrix format and requirements
 * LC-463 https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/description/
 * difficulty: easy
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= grid.size, grid[0].size <= 100
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è done [suboptimal] by myself in 30 mins;
 *  ‚Ä¢ technically this is a traversal type problem, but the point is that it can be solved without recursion and without seen,
 *   simply by traversing through each node in the order it is present in the grid. Since for each node we might compute
 *   statically via a formula how much it contributes to an answer;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî• the traversal algorithm is neither DFS nor BFS. While current node has a neighbor to its right in the grid,
 *   we go right, but when it doesn't, we go down at the first node in the current row! In DFS we would have been alternating
 *   row traversal order.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced solving a graph problem using a matrix-based traversal without seen;
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è should've done much faster? for easy problems timing is 5-15 mins. But I don't see how its that much leet-easy
 *   since it requires a matrix-based graph traversal.

     * problem rephrase:
     *  - given: a graph represented via a matrix, where grid\[i]\[j]==1 is a node, and direct bounds (left,right,bottom,top)
     *   between nodes are edges;
     *  - there is exactly 1 connected component in the graph, and within it's perimeter there are no grid\[i]\[j] == 0;
     *  - assume outside of grid boundary cells there are 0.
     *  - length of a side of a single cell == 1.
     *  Goal: return the perimeter of the connected component
     *   perimeter = sum of all outer sides of the connected component
     *
     * 0  0  0
     *    _ _
     * 0 |1 1|
     *   - -
     * 0  0  0
     *
     * expected = 6
     * total bounds count = 8
     * we don't count the bound between the two cells both times
     *
     *
     * 0 0 0           0 0 0
     * 0 1 0           1 1 1
     * 1 1 1           1 1 1
     * 0 1 0           1 1 1
     *
     * note: the sum for nodes which are surrounded by other nodes on all sides is always 0, so we need to take into
     *  account only boundary nodes.
     *
     * what types of boundary nodes are there?
     *  1. outward line: like in the 1st example, have 3 side with 0's around them;
     *  2. corners or inner line: like in the 3rd example or like in the original example, have 2 neighbor zeros;
     *  3. bricks (in a wall: like in the 3rd example, have only 1 zero around.
     *
     * note: each note contributes to the answer exactly the amount of its neighboring zeros.
     *
     * Approach:
     *  - iterate through the [grid], if cell isn't 0, launch DFS from it;
     *  dfs:
     *   goal: return the sum of all 0's on sides of all nodes in the connected component (count the perimeter of the connected component)
     *   pre-order: as we iterate through neighbors of the current node, add to its perimeter 1 if the neighbor == 0,
     *    else launch dfs and add its result to the perimeter.
     *
     * edge case:
     *  - if a node neighbor is out of bound of the grid => count it as a 0, add to answer!
     *  - there are no cells == 1 in the grid => always return 0;
     *  - inner cells == 0 (surrounded by all cells == 1) are impossible => count only the outward.
     *   impossible by the problem statement
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(nodes + edges) = O(nodes)
     *  edges ~ nodes*4
     *  worst = all nodes are == 1 => we launch dfs from each and try each edges
     *  best = grid(0,0) == 1 and its the only node == 1 => we just check it, 4 its neighbors and return straight away, O(1)
     * Space: always O(nodes)
     *  - seen takes O(nodes)
