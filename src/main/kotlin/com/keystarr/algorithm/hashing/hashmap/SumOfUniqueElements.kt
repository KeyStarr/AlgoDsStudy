     * Idea:
     *  - create hashmap number->count;
     *  - iterate through [nums], if number is present in the hashmap increment its count, otherwise add it into the map
     *      with the count of 1;
     *  - iterate through entries of the hashmap, return the sum of all numbers which have count==1.
     *
     * Edge cases: no real ones, works correctly as-is.
     *
     * Time: always O(n)
     * Space: O(k), where k=amount of distinct numbers in nums (average/worst O(n))

     *
     * can we do better - O(1) space? or a single pass, reduce the time const?
     * (time would anyway be always O(n) since we need to check each element at least once)
     *
     * we could use 2 sets notUnique and unique. As we do a single pass, check if element is in notUnique -> do nothing,
     *  if it's in unique, remove it from there and add to not-unique, if neither -> add to unique.
     * => Time is same but reduced const, but space asymptotically is worse since it'll be always O(n) now.
