/**
 * ⭐LC-7797 https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  - n == graph.length
 *  - 2 <= n <= 15
 *  - 0 <= graph\[i]\[j] < n
 *  - graph\[i]\[j] != i (no self edges)
 *  - all elements in graph\[i] are unique
 *  - the input graph is always a DAG.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  - oh, DFS without seen! Here the problem asks for all paths from one node to another => every time there's an edge
 *   to some node, we must take it, no matter how many times we've visited that node previously. Coz every such time the
 *   path-context is different, and the path-context in this problem is which nodes we had visited so far, with the
 *   original visit order => it's always different. Never seen such a problem before;
 *  - moreover, the problem asks to return all paths and not just, say, a number of paths => we need to actually construct
 *   the path as we traverse nodes. And the efficient way to do this is to use only one instance of the current path
 *   and copy it to the result once the end is reached => i.o. backtracking;
 *  - as in [Combinations], [Permutations] and [Subsets] estimating the time here is hard. Actually here time estimation
 *   is even harder than designing the solution itself for me right now D::::
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  - cool, sometimes it's efficient to use DFS/BFS without seen, sometimes path-context is different for every node visit;
 *  - indeed, backtracking generalizes to graphs, it's a good tool not just for trees;
 *  - practiced recognizing and designing a backtracking solution on an abstract directed acyclic graph problem.

class AllPathsFromSourceToTarget {

    /**
     * goal: return all possible paths from node 0 to node n-1 in a directed acyclic graph.
     * graph input type: array of edges
     *
     * all valid paths in a DIRECTED ACYCLIC graph (no loops!) => try DFS without seen.
     *
     * Time: (n+n!)
     *  lets reason
     *  its not just O(n+e) cause we may visit a node multiple times and each time we visit it we consider all edges from it
     *  =>
     *  the WORST time is when each node has an edge to each while the graph remains acyclic
     *  then the amount of edges = (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3)+...+0 (end node)
     *  => node 1 can be visited once, node 2 can be visited twice, node 3 thrice, and from each visit we got through all edges that that node has
     *  => the total amount of times we traverse via an edge = (n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*..*1 => n!
     * Space:
     *  - the callstack height is k=the size of the longest path in the graph
     *  - the worst (max) amount of result paths = ????
