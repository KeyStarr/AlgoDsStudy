/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a cunning example of an efficiently solution based on 2 queues here, a tricky unique problem all around.
 * LC-649 https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= senate.length <= 10^4;
 *  ‚Ä¢ senate\[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è failed to do by myself in 1h, even the brute-force! I was pulling myself apart going back and forth trying to
 *   do the brute force solution and then thinking I've got an idea for an efficient one switching to that, then back again
 *   + brute force being not so trivial to avoid deleting from the middle of an array => failed to even do the brute force
 *   in the max time frame;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî• what I could've done better: ‚ö†Ô∏è should've at least finished the brute, just focused on that one I guess, even though
 *   it would've significantly been harder than the efficient one to implement (but not to design!). Would've seen possibly
 *   the path to the efficient optimization then;
 *  ‚Ä¢ estimated time wrong at first for [efficient]: noticed that we reduce the size of the list in half every round if we
 *   don't terminate earlier => reasoned we have log(n) rounds and each about ~n iterations, BUT THATS WRONG! We have
 *   indeed log(n) rounds but the total number of iterations across all these, cause of the size always being decreased
 *   /2 sums up to n! n/2+n/8+n/16+.. ~= n
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ùì‚ùì how would one even see the FIFO here to think of 2 queues???? what would they needed to have solved / learned
 *   beforehand, which concepts in their head?
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ solved a game simulation type problem efficiently using 2 queues ("recycling" elements with these also) and a greedy
 *   rule (for the most optimal strategy).

    /**
     * Observations:
     *  1. the order matters, since the earlier senator may remove the latter one;
     *  2. greedy: we're tasked to simulate each player playing optimally => the optimal strategy for each senator is to remove
     *   the first senator of the opposing party in the array. Why? Cause of #1, if they remove another one, they may
     *   needlessly lose an ally. Consider RDRDRD, should the first R remove the second D => the first D removes the second R,
     *   but if each R removes the closest D, then all R's survive.
     *
     * Is there a way to avoid simulating multiple rounds, but just do it in a single pass? Don't see it now.
     *
     * OK, how to at least efficiently simulate the multiple round system?
     *
     * (META - it was kinda hard to phrase these rules such to see FIFO in here!)
     *
     * But if we were to simulate, consider using two queues, one for each party:
     *  - we need to compare the first indexed element of each party to decide which one to remove;
     *  - the other element goes to the end of the queue for the next round of the simulation. Since we store indices,
     *   we need to also set its index with an offset, like if we'd actually remove it and add to the end of the [senate].
     *
     * Do the simulation until one of the queues is empty => return the winner as the other queue.
     *
     * There is always a winner since basically given 2 elements of the opposite parties we always remove 1, and do that
     * until one of the parties doesn't exist => we can't remove all elements of both parties, there would be at least 1 left
     * no matter what the starting size was, if it was >0.
     *
     * Time: always O(n)
     *  - initializing both queues costs O(n);
     *  - running the simulation:
     *   - each step we remove exactly 1 element, so at the end of the first round if we hadn't terminated earlier
     *    we have n/2 elements, then n/4, then n/8
     *    => we have iterations count across all rounds: n/2 + n/4 + n/8 +.. worst all these sum up to n.
     *
     * Space: always O(n)
     *  - we always have max exactly n elements across both queues at the start, then we have only less elements each round.
