/**
 * LC-300 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  â€¢ ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¡super funny how I "failed" to find the DP solution, decided to find a brute-force then first and basically
 *   designed [bottomUpDp] without realizing that it is DP :D Went to lookup the solution with better time complexity
 *   and got confused seeing my very solution labeled as DP. Now I clearly see though that it is DP, since we solve
 *   subproblems continuously aggregating them into bigger subproblems, and reuse solutions for smaller ones to get
 *   at the bigger ones + each choice we make indeed affects further choices;
 *  â€¢ WHY does the course's author and one of the top solutions generally recommend to start solving any DP problem
 *   top-down, and I CONTINUOUSLY (here especially!) find it easier to both start and implement bottom-up? Like here
 *   it's even less code and far less confusing in terms of the recursion callstack for me.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  â€¢ consciously solved the first DP problem ever with the variable amount of calls in the recurrence equation, yay ðŸ”¥
 *  â€¢ practiced both bottom-up and top-down DP approaches.

     * Edge cases: STRICTLY increasing. So strictly less is the only valid previous number for the current number.

     * Space: always O(n)

     * number with which the current number forms a subsequence => just 1 then.

     * to avoid redundant computations, as always, use memoization and save the LIS for each number into a HashMap.
     * we could use IntArray(size=2500), but I wager the map would be a better choice generally due to how much space we'd
     * waste on smaller input sizes.

     *  Space: O(n) even with the callstack, obv.
