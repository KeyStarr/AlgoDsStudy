/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a stark example of a hidden DP problem + what a magnificent core observation here to make about recursive square composition rule
 * LC-221 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= matrix.size, matrix[0].size <= 300;
 *  ‚Ä¢ matrix\[i]\[j] is either '0' or '1'.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è failed [wrongDfs] in 1h10m, designed based in on wrong observation => fail submit. Actually there are cases when there might
 *   be 1's which I formulated as "candidates for squares" but which don't all form a square. E.g. get two square, one bigger
 *   one smaller, and merge the smaller one into the bigger one up to 1/2 deep into one side. We'd not filter any 1's of the
 *   2nd square, coz well, they form a square, but then we'd say both squares form a huge square of combined dimensions, which they don't;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üí° yet again, if one bases the design on correct core observations => its be a swim, like [topDownDp]. But if the
 *   observation are incorrect or lead away from the clean efficient solution, don't utilize the properties required for it
 *   => its gonna be a nightmare.
 *   => üî• observation and induction skills rule! How do I master these? Is this topic based? How to generalize, what are
 *    the useful models/focus points here?
 *  ‚Ä¢ learned the core observation for DP about the recursive square composition from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7Ha2PrDmM
 *   and designed/implemented the rest in all [topDownDp], [bottomUpDp], [bottomUpSpaceOptimizedDp].
 *   üèÖüí°I really just needed that critical observation to make it work, I had the understanding of the DP framework for the rest.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced DP for an efficient solution on a hidden (kinda) DP problem, practiced going from the top-down DP to bottom-up space-optimized;
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced noticing/understanding the core observation on a problem with, really, 1 critical observation to make.
 *   üí° how awesome this is that, if one mastered DP on a decent level, the solution is just about making that observation.
 *    And it can be inferenced here really, live, simply start reasoning from the minimal square possible, then increase
 *    dimension by one, then again by one and find the pattern!!! Which I failed to do for some reason, I think I lacked
 *    confidence, a belief that I CAN find it (plus I've tried this problem initially very tired at 3 am in the morning,
 *    still recovering from the sickness, sooo).

     * Observation:
     *  1. in order to make a 2x2 square with cell X at its top-left corner:
     *   - X must be == 1;
     *   - its neighbors right, bottom right and bottom must be == 1.
     *  2. in order to make a 3x3 square with same X cell:
     *   - its right, bottom right and bottom neighbors must themselves be the top-left corner of valid 2x2 squares.
     *  3. in order to make a 4x4 square at same X:
     *   - these very same neighbors, each must make a valid 3x3 square.
     *  4. if, say, two neighbors make at most a 3x3 square, and one neighbor makes only 2x2 square, then we're bounded
     *   by it and can only make a 3x3 square at cell X, using only 2x2 squares from other two neighbors.
     *   Another example - if one neighbors makes 0 square, i.o. itself == 0, then the largest square we can make at
     *   X is 1x2, X itself.
     *
     * if dp returns the side of the largest square we can make at cell X=(row,col) Int, then:
     * => maxSquare(row, col) = min(maxSquare(row+1, col), maxSquare(row+1,col+1), dp(row,col+1))
     *
     * Observation:
     *  5. node X and its right neighbor both share X's bottom-right node as their neighbors => we'd compute the equation
     *   at least twice. Even X is no the top-left corner in matrix => even more, cause for all top-left nodes which they are
     *   connected by 1s to X, we'd re-compute X etc;
     *   => subproblems overlap AND are clean to compute, don't depend on any previous state
     *
     * => DP, top-down:
     * 1. goal: return the side of the largest square we can make at cell X=(row,col), return type Int
     * 2. input state: rowInd, colInd of the top-left corner of the potential square;
     * 3. recurrence equation:
     *  dp(row, col) = min(dp(row+1, col), dp(row+1,col+1), dp(row,col+1))
     * 4. base cases:
     *  - either row and/or col are out of bounds;
     *  - matrix\[row]\[col] == 0;
     * 5. memoization: Array<IntArray>, where for every top-left corner of the potential square we store its int max square side.
     *
     * Edge cases:
     *  -
     *
     * Time: always O(n*m), we check each cell and for each we compute the answer exactly once;
     * Space: O(n*m) if we allocate the new array for memoization, but we could also modify the original array in which case its O(1).

     *
     *  => a collection of nodes where there is the same amount of each present rowInd/columnInd and all coordinates
     *  form a connected component
     *
     * -----------
     *
     * a graph?
     *
     * a frequency counting problem?
     *
     * for each connected components in the graph:
     *  - traverse, add all column indices into a frequency IntArray index=number->frequency, do same with rows;
     *   rows = 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3
     *   cols = 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 3
     *  -
     *
     * it doesn't make sense to traverse 0's, coz 1's are not always squares even if these are together, might be rectangles.
     *
     *
     * rows =
     *  0: 2
     *  1: 4
     *  2: 5
     *  3: 2
     *
     * columns =
     * 0: 4
     * 1: 1
     * 2: 3
     * 3: 3
     * 4: 2
     *
     * ----------------------
     *
     * what 1's are never a part of a square? (with area >1)
     *  1. if on 3 sides of the cell==1 there are 0's or boundary
     *  2. if 2 sides == 1, but they are opposite
     *
     * so, the cell==1 is only a candidate for a square if it:
     *  - has more than one neighbor==1;
     *  - if two neighbors==1, these must be not on opposite sides;
     *  - all of its neighbors are also valid candidates for a square.
     *
     * idea:
     *  1. "iron out the 1's": traverse through the graph and flip to 0 / mark as not candidates all nodes that:
     *   - exactly 4 sides 0/boundary;
     *   - exactly on 3 sides have 0/boundary;
     *   - exactly 2 sides == 1, but opposite sides.
     *   => we should be left then with only connected components of the graph of rectangular shape which contain only 1's
     *  2. traverse through the graph again, this time for every cell that == 1 and is not seen launch the dfs:
     *   - dfs goal = return the width and the height of the connected component;
     *   - the possible square's area will be min(height,width)*min(height,width).
     *  3. return the max square area across all such connected components.
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - there is no connected component of area > 1 || there are no 1's in the graph => if we ever see at least one 1, mark it, it's possible that after
     *   phase 1 there will be no 1's left. Then return either 1 if we've seen it or 0 if not.
     *
     * Time: always O(n*m)
     *  - first pass we check O(n*m) cells;
     *  - second pass, worst is the entire graph consists of 1's => we check worst O(n*m) cells, but each exactly once.
     * Space: always O(1)
