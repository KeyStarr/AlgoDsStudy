/**
 * üí£ really must fully retry this later, only recognized glimpses of the correct approach!
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è an amazing example of a BST modification type question with a clean recursive case-by-case approach typical for tree type questions
 * LC-450 https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= number of nodes <= 10^4;
 *  ‚Ä¢ -10^5 <= node.val, target <= 10^5;
 *  ‚Ä¢ each node value is unique;
 *  ‚Ä¢ root is a valid BST.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ gave up after 40 mins - the approach I have taken looked way too overcomplicated [wrongOnlyDelete], so I decided no to even
 *   finish designing it, and felt like I probably won't pivot reasonably fast;
 *  ‚Ä¢ good thing I stopped, the solution took a whole new direction! Basically I failed to make 3 key decisions:
 *   1. failed to observe that in case root == target has only one child => we can simply put it in place of the root;
 *   2. failed to see that in case we root == target and two children => we can replace value of the root with the required one
 *    instead of actually deleting root and "scraping" and detaching + attaching the other node in its place;
 *   3. failed to understand that we may simply design the algorithm according to the initial problem statement and therefore
 *    in case root has 2 children we can simply call the function recursively to delete the newfound value that we've assigned
 *    to current root!
 *   All these 3 decisions tremendously simplify the solution + last two rely on observation made in #1, which I failed to see!
 *   Should've handled cases logically one-by-one better, step-by-step, done case-by-case reasoning.
 *  ‚Ä¢ the actual clean efficient solution [deleteAndReplace] is beautiful in its simplicity and recursive step-by-step nature.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced solving a BST modification type problem using a clean recursive case-by-case approach;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî• apparently most tree questions indeed require the best solutions to basically be recursive and answer the original goal
 *   with the original function's signature. Just like LinkedLists with its 1 pass O(n) time O(1) space most of the time being the best characteristics.

     *
     * So, in [wrongOnlyDelete]:
     *  - I correctly assumed that, in case current subtree's root.val == target and root both children
     *   => we need to delete it and replace it with either the largest value node in its left subtree or the smallest
     *    value node in its right subtree;
     *  - but I wrongfully tried to actually "carry over" that smallest/largest node and change its left/right to the
     *   root's left/right children, connecting it to its parent => too complex;
     *  - and I completely missed that in case we have only one child (the other is null) and root == target => we may
     *   simply move either its left or right child in its place as-is, changing nothing else!
     *
     * In [wrongReplaceAndDeleteLeaf] I tried the lightly replacing value instead of hard-deleting and swapping left/right idea,
     *  but not in an optimal way, since I've written some separate algorithm for handling finding the target, and then
     *  to find both either the smallest/largest value and then to actually swap it throughout the entire line down to a leaf,
     *  and delete that leaf in the end.
     *  If I noticed that in case we have exactly either left or right child we could simply swap it in place of the root
     *  => it would've been a lot easier.
     *
     * Here we have key decisions in-place:
     *  1. find the target, but in a modify kinda way => if its in the right subtree, then technically we call the delete algorithm
     *   on it, and it might be deleted => assign the result to the root.right. Vice versa for the left subtree;
     *  2. if root == target:
     *   - if root is a leaf => return null, since we can just delete it (and parent will modify its subtree ref accordingly);
     *   - if root has only one either child => return the only child, since we may simply move it up;
     *   - if root has both children => we may move either the largest node in the left subtree in place of root, or smallest
     *    in right subtree => we chose to only do the smallest in the right one. So we find the smallest and then simply
     *    call delete on it, since it may itself not be a leaf, consider original root=3, target=20:
     *                 3
     *                  20
     *                 15 40
     *                   25 50
     *                    35
     *                   28 37
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(height)
     *  aside from the `findSmallestNode` call we always go down the tree, checking exactly 1 node at every level.
     *  each time we call `findSmallestNode` we effectively find the next target node, and then just go down to it again,
     *  this time with the main removal logic => technically worst case is we call findSmallestNode at the original root node
     *  and then as many times as we reach an actual leaf => we just visit 2*height nodes, cause we check each node then
     *  only exactly twice, and that's the worst case.
     *
     *  best case is when we have root==target and root has only one child => we simply move the other in place of root for O(1) time.
     *  e.g. above example but root=3 target=3
     *
     * Space: O(height) for the callstack
     *  once again findSmallestNode's callstack only adds a const factor to space
