Howdy, folks!

I recently started to truly study algorithms and data structures. I've had various grasps on the subject, but 
never in a comprehensive and at-my-own-pace kind of way. I want to do it for 2 reasons:
1. I love software engineering and am genuinely interested in what tools I might discover to do better work, especially for backend and gamedev;
2. I want to advance my career and work on the best products within the best of teams. It seems that most of those require a rigorous algorithm interview.

Why this rep?
1. I wanna see 'em pretty commit cells painted green as I progress;
2. it's a chance to get feedback should anyone like you decide to tell me exactly why my code is garbage (please, do!); 
3. even if no one looks, I feel your eyes on my back. That hopefully will drive me to push cleaner code more regularly.

Over the years I've grown to think that algorithm and data structure problems are an impenetrable foe I cannot defeat, but recently I've found new tools that I might
actually crack it with. This is a very important challenge for me (coming of age, really), so, heh, let's see how this turns out.

Thanks for stopping by, and may the HashMap be with you.

P.S. This code is not representative of how I do production, cause with leetcode problems there's almost no requirement 
of maintainability. Expect some intentionally messy stuff :) *(but no true spaghetti, I promise. even though I love to eat spaghetti)*
