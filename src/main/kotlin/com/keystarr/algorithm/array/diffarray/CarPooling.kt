/**
 * LC-1094 https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= trips.length <= 10^3
 *  ‚Ä¢ trips\[i].length == 3
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= numPassengers(ith) <= 100
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= from(ith) < to(ith) <= 10^3
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= capacity <= 10^5
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è done [plainSimulation] with 4 failed submissions D: first problem of the day)) gotta be more careful:
 *   ‚Ä¢ forgot to check if the queue is empty before peeking into it => RuntimeException;
 *   ‚Ä¢ mistyped the sorting rule for trips, instead of trips[1] (to) wrote trips[2] (from). Meant `to`, ofc;
 *  ‚Ä¢ done [diffArray] after reading the entire solution concept and dry-running it (didn't understand it before the dry run)
 *   from the DSA course.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ üèÜ solved my first problem on the diff array;
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced a solution using a minHeap.

    /**
     * we don't make choices here, so might just run the problem statement as a simulation, efficiently, on a given input
     *
     * we could sort the array by starting point
     * iterate through the array from the starting point:
     *  trips = trips.sortBy { it.end }
     *  totalCurrentPassengers = trips[0].passengers
     *  activePickups = PriorityQueue<PassengersToEnd>() // minHeap by the trip end value
     *  for i in 1 until trips.size:
     *   trip = trips\[i]
     *   while trip.from >= activePickups.peek().end:
     *    currentPassengers -= activePickups.remove().passengers
     *   totalCurrentPassengers += trip.passengers
     *   if (totalCurrentPassengers > capacity) return false
     *   activePickups.add(trip.passengers to trip.end)
     *  return true
     *
     * Edge cases:
     *  - sum => max total passengers count is 100*10^3 = 10^5 => fits into int
     *  - capacity == 1 => nothing special, correct;
     *  - trips.size == 1 => nothing special, correct
     *
     * Time: always O(nlogn)
     *  - sorting trips O(n*logn)
     *  - main loop:
     *   - priority queue add and remove O(logn)
     *   - inner loop at most O(n) across all outer iterations
     *   - outer loop O(n)
     *   => O(nlogn)
     * Space: average/worst O(n), cause worst we have capacity > totalPassengersCount => we add n elements to the heap.
