/**
 * ðŸ’£ failed to recognize and EVEN struggled to design given the approach => full reinforce later
 * LC-2517 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-tastiness-of-candy-basket/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  â€¢ 2 <= subarrayLength <= prices.length <= 10^5;
 *  â€¢ 1 <= price\[i] <= 10^9.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  â€¢ couldn't solve by myself in 1h [solution] => read all 4 hints, all hinting at details of binary search on solution spaces
 *   => straight away didn't understand how that can even work => dry ran, understood somewhat, at least proved with models
 *   [efficient], but didn't yet quite grasp the full intuition still (have to constantly use 2nd system to "touch" the design,
 *   to get how it works);
 *  â€¢ best valid subset => binary search on solution spaces is most efficient, huh. Didn't even think about it, again!
 *   Just like in [com.keystarr.algorithm.search.binarysearch.solutionspace.MinimumNumberOfDaysToMakeMBouquets] in regard to
 *   not even thinking about the binary search (failed during practice as well), though there the problem asked for the best valid subarray;
 *  â€¢ why didn't I even think to try binary search on solution spaces here though?????
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  â€¢ practiced recognizing and implement binary search on solution spaces.

     * Binary search on solution spaces:
     *  - goal: maximize metric
     *   metric = min abs diff between any two elements
     *  - min possible tastiness: 0
     *  - max possible: 10^5 (or just bound by prices.max())
     *  - elimination properties:
     *   - we can't check fast whether a subset with metric exactly X exists, but we can quickly check if a subset
     *    with metric no less than X exists;
     *   if a subset with metric greater or equal to X AND size exactly k
     *    - exists =>
     *     - there always is a subset with metric less than X (at least this very one we've found, its at least X, so its great than any less)
     *     - there might be a subset with metric greater than X
     *     => increase X
     *    - doesn't exist =>
     *     - trivially, no subset with metric greater than X exists;
     *     - but there might be a subset with metric less than X
     *     => reduce X.
     *  - how do we check if a subset with metric no less than X exists?
     *   sort the [prices], always pick the first element and iterate from left to right, pick exactly (k-1) elements,
     *   each only if (prices\[i] - lastPickedElement) >= X.
     *   so, preprocessing O(nlogn) and each check is O(n)
     *
     * Time: O(nlogn + nlogk) = O(n*(logn+k))
     *  - sorting input O(nlogn)
     *  - worst checks O(logk)
     *  - cost of 1 check is O(n)
     * Space: sort O(logn)
