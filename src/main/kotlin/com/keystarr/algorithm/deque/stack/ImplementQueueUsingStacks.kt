/**
 * LC-232 https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/
 * difficulty: easy
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= x <= 9
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= number of calls across all methods summed <= 100
 *
 * goal: implement a queue using only 2 stacks.
 *
 * incoming all push: 1 2 3 4 5
 * current queue: 1 2 3
 * 1stack: 4 3 2 1
 * 2stack:
 *
 * core operations to design for: push and pop.
 *
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Core DS property: at any method call, [mainStack] must contain all pushed but not popped elements so far in the reversed order.
 * - keep 1 stack always empty, and another must contain elements in the order opposite to insertion;
 * - upon push, pop all elements from one stack to the temp stack, add the new element into the main stack, then add
 *  all prior elements from buff to the main stack => maintain the inverse insertion order.
 * => peek() is just mainStack.peek(), empty() is just mainStack.isNotEmpty()
 *
 * Or is push() supposed to be Time O(1)? Don't think so, generally the Queue is expected to be so, but it still depends on the implementation.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ done by myself in 20 mins. Got the intuition from the start that there must be some kinda property to maintain using
 *   the two stacks in between each modification calls, but struggled to find it while playing with possible algorithm
 *   decisions live using an input/output example (poking it with a stick!) helped tremendously by the way üî•;
 *  ‚Ä¢ LOL 20 mins on easy problem ‚ö†Ô∏è. Not sure what I could've done better, just sorta not overcomplicate stuff, cause
 *   I expected this to have some complexity like mediums. What did we learn, Palmer?
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced Stacks and Queues.
