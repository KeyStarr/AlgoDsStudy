/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a unique (so far) example of a DP problem where top-down is only O(n^2), but bottom-up trivially gives O(n) time!
 * LC-1218 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5;
 *  ‚Ä¢ -10^4 <= nums\[i], targetDiff <= 10^4.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ done [startsAtTopDownDp] in 40 mins, got TLE on 38th/41 tests. Improved the time but only const => submit success at 51 mins :D
 *   But basically its just improved brute force, there obviously is a much better solution asymptotically. Since I'm near
 *   the time limit of 1h, and I don't see any leads to improve the current solution => just learn the official solution then;
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è chose the wrong end to start DP from  => again! Just as in  earlier TODAY.
 *   should've not postponed time estimation => would've caught early on that worst is still O(n^2) and that there's gotta be
 *   a better way => should've invested time in finding that?
 *    ‚ö†Ô∏è I doubt however I'd see the other end approach though since I just fixated upon the chosen one like its the only way to do DP here..
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ unlike [com.keystarr.algorithm.dp.multidim.HouseRobberII] where I chose the wrong end to start from, here I just
 *   never done the bottom-up! It turns out that here, no matter from which end we start (either we search for the max length
 *   of the subsequence that STARTS or ENDS with nums\[i]), the best top-down is O(n^2) but TRIVIALLY bottom-up from either
 *   side is O(n)!
 *   => üî•üî•üí° should've just pushed and done bottom-up, as routinely at least that sometimes gives space optimizations
 *   => here would've discovered a huge time optimization as well!!!
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ i.o. done [startsAtTopDownDp] optimized a const but got stuck at O(n^2) and gave up. It turns out that top down from another
 *   direction has basically same time complexity [endsAtTopDownDp], BUT bottom-up from both direction is efficient O(n)
 *   [startsAtBottomUpDp] [endsAtBottomUpDp]!!!
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ basically a subproblem of [LongestArithmeticSubsequence] almost as-is.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ for the first time encountered a case where bottom-up is trivially drastically faster than top-down! And when starting
 *  from either side here! Made a mistake of stopping at top-down and trying to optimize it instead of the trying the bottom-up straight away.
 *  => üî•üí° in the future if top-down DP looks too slow: try another side, or just straight away try bottom-up first, and only THEN
 *   change sides!!!
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced recognizing solving a "find the best valid combination=subsequence" type problem using a one-dim DP bottom-up, efficiently.

     * observe:
     *  1. if diff > 0 we have a strictly increasing subsequence;
     *  2. if diff < 0 => strictly decreasing;
     *  3. if diff == 0 => the longest subsequence of equal elements.
     *
     * how to choose the first element?
     *
     * e.g. 3 5 6 7 8 10 12, diff=2
     *
     * 3 5 7
     * 6 8 10 12

     *  worst is when all adjacent elements in nums have diff [targetDiff], then we do approximately n*n/2 iterations
     * Space O(1)
     *
     * ---------- how to optimize? ----------
     *
     *  basically goal = find the best valid combination, return the metric
     *   valid = a valid subsequence (only elements from [nums], a single element can be used exactly once, order) with
     *   adjacent elements diff of exactly [targetDiff]
     *   metric = length
     *   best = max length
     *
     * observation: actually, we don't need to return the subsequence => we just need the length of longest!
     *
     * what if we sort [nums]? no can do - order matters, since the constraint is for adjacent elements in the original order
     *
     * may subproblems overlap?
     *
     *  consider nums=3 5 6 7 8 10 12, targetDiff=2
     *
     *  one valid subsequence is: 6 8 10 12
     *   we discover it as we start from 6
     *   note: when we start from 8, since targetDiff is the same, we already know that the longest subsequence of nums[4:6] is 2,
     *    as we would have calculated it when we tried it for 6
     *  => subproblems do overlap => try dp!
     *
     * top-down DP:
     *  - goal: return the maximum longest subsequence of the subarray nums[leftInd:] starting from the number nums\[leftInd] (!!!!! what i've missed to see)
     *   such that the diff between all adjacent elements is exactly [targetDiff];
     *   return value: max length, integer
     *  - input state:
     *   leftInd: Int - denotes the start of the subarray of [nums] that is the current suproblem's input;
     *  - recurrence equation:
     *   dp(lI) = if nums has value == lI+targetDiff => dp(nextIndex) + 1 else 1
     *  - base cases:
     *   lI == nums.size => return 0
     *
     * nums=3 6 8 5 10 7 12, targetDiff=2
     *
     * dp= 0:3,3:2, 5:1
     *
     * dp(lI=0)
     * targetNext=3+2=5
     *  nI=1, 6 != 5
     *  nI=2, 8 != 5
     *  nI=3, 5==5
     * dp(0) = dp(3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
     *
     * dp(lI=3)
     * targetNext=5+2=7
     *  nI=4, 10 !=5
     *  nI=5, 7==7
     * dp(3) = dp(5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
     *
     * dp(lI=5)
     *  targetNext=7+2=9
     *  nI=6, 12 != 5
     *  nI=7, base case, return 0
     *  dp(5) = 1
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - nums.length == 1 => expected is always return 1 => correct as-is, loop's body will never be entered in [startsAtTopDownRecursive].
     *
     * Time: ‚ö†Ô∏è average/worst O(n^2) still same as brute, only a better const on average.
     *  (üèÜ HAH, postponed time estimation coz it looked complex, didn't know where to start => üî•focused attention through the "worst case" mode, and it all clicked!)
     *  worst case is there are no 2 numbers in [nums] such that the diff between them == [targetDiff] => we launch [startsAtTopDownRecursive]
     *  with each number, and check every other number to the right of it => still O(n^2)
     * Space: always O(n)
     *
     *
     * => WRONG - TLE at 38th/41 test case
     *
     * --------
     * How to optimize [startsAtTopDownDp] even further, to actually get below O(n^2) time?
     *
     * binary search on solution spaces? no, cause suppose target length no less/no greater than X, how to check it?
     *  we have to start at each number => O(n^2) time, doesn't make sense
     *
     * DP could still be optimized for equal numbers => if we've already encountered a number X, computed the result for it,
     *  we should skip all numbers equal to it! Proof is laid out at [startsAtTopDownRecursive]:
     *   a duplicate number to a previously encountered one can never have greater valid subsequence length)
     *
     * => that still only improves the const, worst is still O(n^2) time.
