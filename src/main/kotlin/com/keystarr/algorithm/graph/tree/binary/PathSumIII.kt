/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è a stark example of a "prefix sum" being the key to an efficient solution for not an array input (binary tree here)
 *
 * LC-437 https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/
 * difficulty: medium (one of the hardest mediums I've encountered, with so much going on)
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= number of nodes <= 10^3;
 *  ‚Ä¢ -10^9 <= node.val <= 10^9;
 *  ‚Ä¢ -10^3 <= targetSum <= 10^3.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ at first I first the efficient solution was DP since we have we need to count all valid combinations essentially (valid tree paths,
 *   including "partial" paths), and the subproblems overlap, so I went for [topDownDp]. Spent about 30-40 mins there and failed;
 *  ‚Ä¢ then tried just a brute force. Couldn't figure it out at first, so went into the discussion section cause I sort of just
 *   gave up. Picked up a clue that one of the solutions involves 2 recursion functions. At this point spent ~1.5h at this problem;
 *  ‚Ä¢ did [wrongBruteDfs] the following day in about 30 mins. Failed a submit, dry ran and understood the error, redesigned
 *   the approach by myself and did [bruteDfsCountAllValidPaths] at about 1h mark;
 *  ‚Ä¢ gave up and checked the solution finally, learned of the core concept using the prefix sum on the tree =>
 *   designed the rest by myself and done [efficientPrefixSum] at about 3h time mark (total invested into this problem);
 *  ‚Ä¢ also I was so overwhelmed with that main solution that I failed the trivial edge case of sum being Long :D (failed a submit)
 *  ‚Ä¢ i.o. failed to come up both with even a brute force solution, let alone the efficient one, and spent quite some
 *   time to get on board with both.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ learned that the prefix sum tool is an efficient way to count all valid partial sums (of consecutive portions of some
 *   sequences of elements) not for just arrays, but really any consecutive collections of elements, including trees (which, in retrospect, is super
 *   obvious. I could've recognized the tool here if I abstracted the goal right as "count all valid consecutive parts of the collection
 *   valid = target sum";
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced solving a "count all valid full/partial paths in the binary tree" type problem.

    /**
     * Let's go back to the first observation made in [topDownDp] - subproblems overlap!
     *
     * e.g. tree = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
     *  as we start from 1, we need the all valid paths count from 3 that had leftSum = X at the call
     *  it so might happen that 1.val==2.val, then as we start either from 1 or from 2 leftSum at 3 would be equal
     *  and other more complex cases might arise with a similar outcome of node/sum duplication.
     *
     * input state:
     *  - root: TreeNode
     *  - leftSum: Int
     *
     * time would then be though still O(n*s), where can be anywhere in [-10^12;10^12]
     *
     * ------------------------- nope, there's a better one
     *
     * basically we need to count all partial sums of the tree which == [targetSum]. How to efficiently compute a partial
     *  sum for each subtree? We know how to efficiently compute a partial sum for each subarray => prefix sum. Why not use it here?
     *
     * Core concept:
     *  - iterate through the tree in a single DFS;
     *   - add each node to the current sum => compute the current prefix sum;
     *   - after computing the new prefix sum, store it in the dictionary. üî• but along with its frequency, since negative values
     *    are allowed => we might have multiple equal prefix sums;
     *   - at each node compute exactly what any previous prefix sum must have been in order for some part of the tree
     *    ending at the current node to sum up to [targetSum] => check the prefixSum dictionary, if there was one =>
     *    such a part (a continuous part of the tree starting at some previous visited node and ending at the current node)
     *    exists (maybe even multiple such parts/paths) => add all occurrences to the total count then;
     *   - ‚ùóÔ∏è as we backtrack, remove the current prefix sum from the tree, as for every node we consider paths that only go
     *    from nodes at lower levels to higher levels, with level only steadily increasing.
     *
     * the case when root.val == targetSum is covered as then simply (newSum - targetSum) would equal to the prefix sum
     *  at the previous node => count paths of length == 1 node as well.
     *  e.g.
     *  targetSum = 2
     *      1
     *     2 3
     *
     * at 2 currentSum = 3, and in the map there is 1:1 => currentSum-targetSum =3-2=1 map[1] ==  1
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - sum => max sum = 10^3 * 10^9 = 10^12 => use Long for sum.
     *
     * Time: always O(n)
     *  we visit each node exactly once => have n [efficientDfs] calls, it just being a regular dfs.
     * Space: average/worst O(n)
     *  worst map size is when at each node we have a distinct sum => n+1 entries
     *
