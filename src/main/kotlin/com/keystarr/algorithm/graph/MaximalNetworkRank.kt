/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è wow, a graph properties question with NO O(n) or O(nlogk) solution! only a plain brute O(n^2)
 * LC-1615 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-network-rank/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 2 <= number of nodes <= 100;
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= edges.size <= n * (n-1)/2
 *  ‚Ä¢ roads\[i].size == 2, 0 <= roads\[i][0] and [1] <= n-1, no self-edges;
 *  ‚Ä¢ all edges\[i] are unique sets (each pair of cities has only at most one edge in \[edges]).
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ designed brute in 10 mins;
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è done [bruteForce] at 1h 17 mins mark!
 *  ‚Ä¢ mistakes:
 *   ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è1st understood the problem wrong! interpreted it such that the 2 nodes MUST BE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER,
 *   which is not the case, we need ANY two nodes [wrongBrute];
 *   ‚Ä¢ thought then its a top k=2 maxes by edges count problem, but it turns out there are a lot of edge cases because of
 *    the "don't count the road between the nodes if they are connected" requirement. So that approach doesn't work;
 *   ‚Ä¢ finally tried another heuristic [wrongEfficient] but that failed due to these same rule spawned edge cases.
 *  => wow, a graph metric problem with only a brute n^2 solution, that can happen, and with such a deceivingly simple problem statement...
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ü§∑ what did we learn, Palmer? Honestly, I'm not sure how I could've done better here. These edges cases cause of that
 *   rule were so deep under the water... how to do better in the future in such situations?
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced solving a graph metric calculation problem without full traversal using graph properties.

     * problem rephrase:

     *   valid=there is an edge connecting these 2 cities

     *
     * can we have self-edges?
     * can we have duplicate edges in the array of edges? that is, is edge\[i] a unique set of numbers in edges?
     *
     * probably either way:
     *  transform array of edges into a map node->neighbors => we can traverse efficiently, and can in O(1) time
     *   get the amount of edges for the ith city;
     *
     * brute force:
     *  - iterate through the map, for each node find the neighbor node with the max amount of edges =>
     *   update maxRank with the total amount of edges in these two - 1 (to not count an edge between them twice);
     * Time of just that: always O(n^2)
     *  - n iterations always;
     *  - worst each node has an edge to each => each iteration we'd be doing, even if we start at j=i+1 O(n) work)
     *
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - edges == 0 => answer is always 0 => correct as-is, though we could early return for O(1) time.

     * WOW, I understood the question wrong!

     * its actually
     *
     * goal: find ANY best pair of cities, and return its metric
     *  best=amongst other pairs, these 2 cities have the max sum of all edges connected to them.
     * => simply find 2 cities with max edges
     * and if both are connected, return c1.edges.size + c2.edges.size - 1
     *
     * => approach:
     *  1. count edges using IntArray node->edges count;
     *  2. use minHeap to find top k (k=2) max edges nodes.
     *
     * Edge cases:
     *  - edges.size == 0 => correct as-is, but may return 0 for O(1) time;
     *
     *
     *  - there is 1 node and multiple nodes with either same max edges count, or next max edges count => choose such 2 nodes
     *   that they are both not connected, if there are no such, choose either of these.
     *
     *   can we account for that before finding 2 max edges nodes?
     *   if we preserve the info about exact neighbors.
     *   =>
     *   find the node with max edges count AND find the next max edges count city that is not connected to it +
     *    find max edges count city that is connected to it => choose the max of these two?
     *
     *    edge case: if max edges node has X edges and all max2 edges Y nodes are connected to it AND some 2 max2 nodes
     *    are not connected to each other and X-Y=1, then pair X+Y is X+Y-1 edges and Y+Y is (X-1)+Y edges = choose either one.
     *    its ok
     * ---------------------
     *
     * WRONG, since top1 and top2 nodes by edges might be connected => their rank must then be subtracted -1
     * AND there might be other, e.g. equal node to top1 by edges size yet not connected to top2. or equal to top2 node
     * not connected to top1.
     * =>
     * approach #3:
     *  - find max edges node;
     *  - find max edges node other than it that is connected to it, and another max edges that is not connected to it;
     *  - return max edges node edgesSize + (either not connected or (connected - 1) whichever is max)
     *
     * => WRONG
     * 0 - 2
     *  \
     *   1
     * 0: 2,1
     * 1: 0
     * 2: 0
     *
     * most edges = 0
     * most edges other connected = 1
     * most edges other not connected = null
     * return 0.edges + 1.edges - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2
     * correct
     *
     *
     * 2 - 3 - 0 - 4 - 1
     *
     * 0:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:4
     *
     * most edges = 0 (cause out of all 2 edges nodes 0 happens to be the first one to be found in the max search loop)
     * most edges other connected = 3
     * most edges other not connected = 2
     * actual = 0.edges + max(3.size - 1, 2.size) = 2 + max(1,1)=3
     * expected = 3.edges + 4.edges = 2 + 2 = 4 (3 and 4 nodes are not connected!)
     *
     * so if we have multiple max edges nodes, and it so happens to be that some max of these are not connected, these are the answer
     *  but we might find out of those the one that is connected to another max wrongly
     * => we could remedy that by checking, if we have multiple max edge nodes, if there are at least 2 that are not connected,
     *  then pick them as the answer, but worst case that would take O(n^2) if all nodes values are equal and each is connected
     *  to each except the last which is not connected to just one node => we'd have to check each node with each for connections
     * => generally no point, same worst as [bruteForce] and too complex
