    /*
    Just for the record - I have failed with 2 approaches to come up with a solution faster than O(n^2) time:
        1. tried to O(nlogn) by sorting & doing binary search.
            failed cause we need to calculate ALL distinct pairs of same numbers => I'd count only
            one pair per one number at first. And to mark found numbers as counted to rerun binary search until
            it gave -1 for current number would be too laborsome (there's gotta be a better solution!)
        2. a dumb but ambitious idea:
            2.1) add all nums into a hashmap and count all collisions per key;
                turns out theres no HashMap implementation in kotlin/java stdlibs that would give access
                to collision count or to buckets directly => I even implemented my own terrible custom Hashmap;
            2.2) sum up the number of good pairs by the formula for each key-collisionsCount:
                (customized distinct permutations, feels off though)
                ((collisionsCount!)/((collisionsCount - 1)!) / 2)
                Obviously, here I hit a wall and crashed, cause worst case would be 100! and that
                is terribly slow, not to mention integer overflow...

    Turns out we coulda just done a single pass and count the sum via simple arithmetics for O(n)....

 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a great example of a blind re-solve with a huge improvement in quality
 * LC-1512 https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/description/
 * difficulty: easy
 * constraints:
 *  - 1 <= nums.size <= 100;
 *  - 1 <= nums\[i] <= 100.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  - done [efficient] by myself in 15 mins;
 *  - "–∑–∞—Ü–µ–ø–∏–ª—Å—è", caught the crucial problem property straight away: "i < j" constraint looked weird => observed that
 *   cause of that we simply need to count each distinct pair exactly once;
 *   => inferred then that we just need to count the number of number frequencies, and we can compute each distinct pair
 *    via O(1) time;
 *  - ‚ö†Ô∏è struggled a bit with the formula to compute number of distinct pairs, but DRY RAN üî• the computation => recognized
 *   an arithmetic progression with the step of -1 and endNumber=frequencies.lastInd-1 => then remembered and checked the formula
 *   for that through dry running;
 *  - apparently, I've already solved that problem about 3 months ago :D Back then I failed to come up with the O(n) solution
 *   at all, only done O(n^2). Didn't record the time, but probably invested quite some.
 *
 *   This time I HAD NO RECOLLECTION of encountering that problem earlier WHATSOEVER üôÄ that happened before with a few other problems!
 *
 *   But this time I managed to do a O(n) solution in 15 mins üèÜüèÜ And I followed a different approach, not the cleanest,
 *    but still an efficient one! Crazy) This time I knew to observe, to reason faster and start from the problem statement
 *    noting sticking out properties of the original problem and trying to find a solution angle from it! And did it üî•
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  - practiced solving a "valid combinations counting" type problem efficiently using an array for counting and arithmetic progression formula.
