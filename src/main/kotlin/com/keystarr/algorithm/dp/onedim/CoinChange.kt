 * ‚≠êÔ∏è LC-322 https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ coins.length <= 12
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= coins\[i] <= 2^31 -1 // fits into Int
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= amount <= 10^4
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è couldn't solve in 1h by myself:
 *   ‚Ä¢ failed to find the DP approach ‚ö†Ô∏è to the problem!
 *    ‚Ä¢ before now solved only problems where problem reduction was to
 *     basically make a step and "cut" 1 element from the array of all values that needed to be processed, that was the only
 *     definition of the remaining problem I've worked with;
 *    ‚Ä¢ here I reasoned:
 *     ‚Ä¢ the amount of slots (coins possible to take) is unknown, implicitly unbounded only by the relationship between
 *      the [amount] and [coins] available;
 *     ‚Ä¢ tried somehow using and removing a coin from [coins], like, trying amount%coin and amount/coin etc. Failed to
 *      see problem reduction that way;
 *     ‚Ä¢ completely DIDN'T EVEN THINK of the problem space via just [amount] üí° and trying to making 1 step => reducing it.
 *      (which was the correct approach).
 *     ‚Ä¢ eventually just tried to do greedy [greedyWrong] and failed miserably on like 8X/160 cases, which was unreasonably
 *      complicated to even dry run and understand the issue (due to no actual final min amount combination of coins
 *      given in the answer, just the amount).
 *  ‚Ä¢ studied Editorial and 1 top submission => ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL couldn't understand the solution!!!
 *   ONLY after watching Neetcode's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9bfqozjoqs&ab_channel=NeetCode understood it finally,
 *   I guess that's coz he managed to visually and gradually lead from the brute force along multiple optimizations
 *   on a concrete example to the final optimized solution. What a chad.
 *  ‚Ä¢ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–ª –º–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–π—é, –±—É–∫–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ, —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –≤–∏–∂—É —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ, –≤—Ç—Ñ, –º–æ–ª, –∫–∞–∫ —Ä–∞–Ω—å—à–µ –Ω–µ –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª;
 *  ‚Ä¢ interesting, it seems that [topDownDp] actually might on average require less different amount states computations,
 *   since [bottomUp] computes for exactly [amount] states always, and [topDownDp] only for those states reachable by the
 *   subtraction of valid combinations of coins, which may be far less than the actual [amount]! (though callstack is a
 *   weight still). Anyway that's a matter of const and not important asymptotically;
 *  ‚Ä¢ yet again I failed 1 submission just cause I spent so much effort on the solution I forgot to eventually, for top-down,
 *   to add memoization(((( => TLE due to duplicate calls.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•first time solved a DP problem where the actual problem division was to be performed not by cutting 1 element
 *   out of the input collection, but reducing an Integer representing the problem space!
 *  ‚Ä¢ try designing DP top-down by default like that?
 *   - what is a single step?
 *   - how to reduce the problem?
 *   - when do we get the answer?
 *   => what's the recurrent relation?
 *   - what are base cases?

     * WRONG SOLUTION, WRONG APPROACH
     * like in [SolvingQuestionsWithBrainpower], decided to leave it for further retrospection
     *
     * ---------------
     *
     * goal: if it's possible to combine coins to reach the exact [amount], return the minimum amount of coins, otherwise -1.
     * given: all possible denominations of coins, each of which may be used infinite number of times.
     *
     * what to use?
     *  - multiple steps
     *  - end goal is the best (->min) combination
     *  - each step affects future choices (cause amount-=chosenCoin), BUT we can still take any coin that fits under
     *   the left amount => more like pure greedy than DP?
     *
     * try "greedy":
     *  - sort the coins
     *  - for maxCoinInd = coins.size-1 downTo 0:
     *   - maxCoinsMax = left / coins\[maxCoinInd]
     *   - for maxCoinsTaken = maxCoinsMax downTo 1:
     *    - left = amount - maxCoinsTaken*coins[maxCoinInd]
     *    - if (left == 0) return maxCoinsTaken
     *    - iterate through rightInd = maxCoinInd-1 downTo 0:
     *     - currentCoin = coins[rightInd]
     *     - takeCoins = left / currentCoin
     *     - if takeCoins == 0:
     *      - break
     *     - coinsCount += takeCoins
     *     - left -= takeCoins * currentCoin
     *     - if left == 0:
     *      - return coinsCount
     * - return -1
     *
     * Edge cases:
     *  - amount == 0 => minCoin==1 => always return 0 => early return check;
     *  - coins.length == 1 => answer is amount/coins[0] division remainder is 0, otherwise-1 => correct, the first answer condition
     *   in the maxCoinTaken loop will be met.
     *
     * Time: O(nlogn+n*k*n)=O(nlogn + k*n^2) = O(k*n^2)
     *  - sort the coins O(logn)
     *  - maxCoinInd has n states
     *   - maxCoinsTaken has average/worst k = amount/coins.max() states
     *   - otherCoins have maxCoinInd-1 states for each iteration => average/worst n states
     * Space: O(1)

     * - what is a step? to reach the [amount] we can take exactly 1 of ANY coin (they're infinite)

     * - what is the answer?

     *  but map may be better space-wise, yet slower on write/read due to object creation (Entry) and hash computation
     *  since worst [amount] is 10^4, prefer a hashmap.

     *  - all choices from the current [amount] lead to -1 answer => return -1 (no valid combination exists for the given amount)
