/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è such a simple statement yet such a hard solution, I'm still not grasping it completely
 * LC-787 https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/
 * difficulty: medium (definitely a leet-hard!)
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= n=nodesAmount <= 100
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= adjacencyArray.size <= n*(n-1)/2
 *  ‚Ä¢ adjacencyArray\[i].size == 3
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= from ith, to ith < n
 *  ‚Ä¢ from ith != to ith
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= price ith <= 10^4
 *  ‚Ä¢ no multiple flights between cities => exactly one edge between 2 cities?
 *  ‚Ä¢ 0 <= start, end, pathMaxNodes < nodes
 *  ‚Ä¢ start != end
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ failed 6 (SIX!!) submissions. That's the new anti-record, beats even learning DP for me;
 *  ‚Ä¢ my critical mistake:
 *   just learned the concept and a typical implementation pattern for Dijkstra's, and for this problem ASSUMED (that wasn't in the article)
 *    that we could just run Dijkstra's until the heap is empty (modified with the max stops constraint ofc), and then simply
 *    return `minPathWeights\[finish]`;
 *     => actually we might have the last visit to the `finish` node such that it is less in stops than actual min weight result
 *     => we'd simply overwrite the min weight result with less stops, but more weight => incorrect answer
 *     => actually, we need to return the weight of the first path to reach `finish`. It is GUARANTEED to be the min weight
 *      path, cause each time we reach a new node path weight increases (weight>0) => if we added the final node into the
 *      heap, yet there's a less weight path in the graph, we won't take that node out of the heap before we walk that path fully,
 *      because then at EACH node that path's weight will be less than the added path's weight!
 *     + we add the finish node into the heap ONLY when we actually VISIT the node BEFORE IT (as it's neighbor) =>
 *      if we return on adding, it's wrong, coz it might not be the min path.
 *    üî•PROVED why we must return the path weight of the finish node the first time we REMOVE it out of the heap (not add!).
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ it's so weird that we update BOTH the stops AND the min weight if encounter either better stops OR weight. Well we
 *   update both cause we consider it the best combination, and these are, like, 2 properties of a single path, BUT
 *   why update on just EITHER condition met? why not on ONLY less weight OR less stops? Well [trackOnlyMinStops] actually
 *   excludes weight from the rules;
 *
 *  ‚Ä¢ I had to spend good 3-4 hours and dry-run up to 10 times to understand exactly why we return just when we visit the
 *   finish node first, and I still don't even understand clearly how does "track min stops only" solution works. Neither
 *   the complexities of both solutions. Why so hard for me? A great learning opportunity though.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced adapting Dijkstra's algorithm to a min path directed graph problem with an additional constraint on the path;
 *  ‚Ä¢ TODO: figure out exactly why does [trackOnlyMinStops] work and what and why exactly are the complexities for both solutions.
 *   decided to postpone, since the topic is quite niche for current goals, yet requires so much effort

     *
     * goal = a path with minimum weight => try Dijkstra's
     * additional constraint = at most [maxNodes], how to check for it?
     *  record for each NodeVisit: node, pathWeight and also nodesVisited, if, upon taking an edge, nodesVisited == [maxNodes] - 1
     *   and node != endNode don't consider using that edge, prune.

     * main body = pure Dijkstra's

     * Edge cases:
     *  - nodesAmount==1 => impossible, cause start != end, problem constraints are wrong;
     *  - no edges from the [start] => return -1, correct;
