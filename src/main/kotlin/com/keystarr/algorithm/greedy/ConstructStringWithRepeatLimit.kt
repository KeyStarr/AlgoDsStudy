/**
 * ‚≠êÔ∏è a great example of a greedy optimized string generation type problem
 * LC-2182 https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-with-repeat-limit/description/
 * difficulty: medium
 * constraints:
 *  ‚Ä¢ 1 <= repeatLimit <= input.size <= 10^5;
 *  ‚Ä¢ input consists of only lowercase English.
 *
 * Final notes:
 *  ‚Ä¢ üèÜ done [efficient] by myself in 30-35 mins. Spent another 10 mins to prove the time complexity to be O(n)
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî•started to observe, reduce the solution space and caught on the greedy choice straight away;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî• design-phase caught the only major edge case here with hitting the repeatLimit and not having any other distinct chars left;
 *  ‚Ä¢ üî• almost straight away came up with the optimization to count chars using an IntArray to avoid sorting as we need to
 *   iterate in a descending alphabetic value order through the available chars. If we'd have more distinct chars, or they'd
 *   be more sparse => it'd better to use a map for counting and sort its entries for O(klogk) time.
 *
 * Value gained:
 *  ‚Ä¢ practiced solving the best valid string generation type problem using greedy and optimized char counting via an array.

     * problem rephrase:
     *  - given:
     *   - input: String
     *   - repeatLimit: Int
     *  - goal: generate and return the lexicographically largest valid string
     *   valid = achieved via a permutation of [input], but with additional constraints:
     *    - each character can be no more than [repeatLimit] in a row;
     *    - we don't have to use all characters.
     *
     * lexicographically largest => the first pos to differ from any other valid strings got to be largest in the result string
     *
     * observations:
     *  1. we must use all available characters in the descending order alphabetically, but respecting the [repeatLimit].
     *   If we can't add the remaining largest character alphabetically due to the repeat constraint, add a single instance
     *   of the next largest available character, then use the initial largest char;
     *  2. we may not use all characters in [input] ONLY if by following the p.1 logic we arrive at the situation such that
     *   the only remaining characters are all instances of the same char, and current string ends with said character repeated
     *   exactly [repeatLimit] times.
     *   We don't use all chars, but since at every step we made the greedy choice of taking the maximum possible char
     *   to maximize the lexi value => that string is the largest lexi we can get.
     *
     * how to start?
     *  1. sort [input];
     *  2. or count all chars in [input] and then sort entries.
     *  actually, just use an int array for counting since we only have lowercase English letters in [input] => automatically
     *  get them in the sored order!
     *
     * edge cases:
     *  - input.length == 1 => always return input as result (a new instance is allowed) => correct as-is;
     *  - repeatLimit == 1 => nothing special, correct as-is;
     *  - repeatLimit == input.length => at each step append the max available amount of the largest char remaining =>
     *   min(repeatLimit, charToFreq\[i]) would always result in charToFreq\[i] => correct as-is;
     *  - we've used up the [repeatLimit] of the remaining largest char for the current streak, but there are no other
     *   chars left => check for this special condition => early return if so the result built so far.
     *
     * Time: average/worst O(n)
     *  - we have up to k = max distinct chars count, worst k=26 iterations of the outer loop;
     *  - we have up to g = (charFreq/repeatLimit) iterations of the 2nd inner loop. Worst is repeatLimit==1 and charFreq == input.size / 2
     *   and next char would have input.size / 2 instances for the repeat limit logic to work. But in total, across all
     *   outer loop iterations 1st inner loop has up to input.length iterations;
     *  - the 2nd inner loop sets the nextLargestRemainInd, and across all outer loop iterations it can only move up to through
     *   input.length elements => have up to n iterations => contributes only a const to O(n).
     * Space: always O(k + n) = O(26 + n) = O(n)
     *  - charToFreq array is always O(k), where k=max distinct chars count, here its always k=26;
     *  - string builder is up to n size.
